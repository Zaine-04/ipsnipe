  - Sensitive file discovery with automated testing for 25+ sensitive files common in HTB
  - Parameter discovery testing common HTB parameters (id, user, debug, cmd, include, etc.)
  - Enhanced technology fingerprinting using WhatWeb + header analysis + response fingerprinting

### üìö Research-Backed HTB Wordlist Integration

- **HTB Balanced Approach** - `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt` (different ordering strategy)
- **HTB Comprehensive** - `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt` (maximum coverage)
- **Specialized Wordlists** - API endpoints, parameters, backup files, and subdomain discovery lists
- **Automatic SecLists Installation** - Essential HTB wordlists installed during setup

### üõ†Ô∏è HTB-Optimized Tool Installation
- **Gobuster** - Fast directory enumeration with HTB-optimized SecLists integration
- **Subfinder** - Advanced subdomain enumeration with certificate transparency and passive discovery
- **Amass** - Advanced OSINT enumeration for comprehensive subdomain and asset discovery
- **DNSRecon** - Advanced DNS reconnaissance with zone transfers, brute force, and record enumeration
- **SecLists** - Essential HTB wordlists with community-proven effectiveness
- **Enhanced install.sh** - Multi-platform installation (Debian/Ubuntu, macOS, Arch) with intelligent fallbacks

### ‚öôÔ∏è HTB-Optimized Configuration
- **New [advanced_dns] Section** - Certificate transparency, reverse DNS, zone transfer settings with HTB-optimized timeouts
- **New [enhanced_web] Section** - JavaScript analysis, sensitive files, parameter discovery settings optimized for HTB
- **Research-Based Defaults** - All settings optimized based on HTB community research and testing
- **Configurable via config.toml** - All HTB optimizations fully configurable in single file
- **Fallback Compatibility** - Graceful degradation when advanced tools aren't available

### üéÆ Enhanced User Interface
- **Menu Option 9** - Advanced DNS Enumeration (HTB-optimized with certificate transparency, zone transfers)
- **Menu Option 10** - Enhanced Web Discovery (HTB-optimized with JavaScript analysis, multi-tool enumeration)  
- **Menu Option 11** - theHarvester (moved from position 9)
- **Clear HTB Indicators** - Visual indicators for HTB-optimized features and capabilities

### üìä Technical Architecture Improvements
- **6-Phase DNS Enumeration** - Comprehensive approach vs. 3-phase basic DNS
- **6-Phase Web Discovery** - Multi-tool approach vs. single-tool scanning
- **Enhanced Scanner Integration** - Seamless workflow with existing reconnaissance flow
- **Professional Error Handling** - Comprehensive timeout and error management
- **Performance Optimized** - Parallel processing with intelligent timeouts

### üîß Expected HTB Performance Improvements
- **Subdomain Discovery** - 300%+ improvement with certificate transparency and advanced tools
